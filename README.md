# No More Commandline (NMCL)
The NMCL (No More Command Line) project. A project focused on 
making CLI tools available for those that would benefit
from them.  



## FAQ

#### Why?
This project was mainly just to improve my programming skills.
However I do believe GUI-izing cli tools can be beneficial to those
who are not tech-savy or people with sight problems.


#### How can I contribute?
I honestly wouldn't. I doubt this project will go anywhere.
If you really want to, I'd start from stratch as you're probably
a better programmer than I am.
